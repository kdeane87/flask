  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
  Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
  inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
  Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous
  Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their
  company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
  Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
  prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also
  considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
  leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

    <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
    <p>
      Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of
      the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of
      the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770.
      While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was
      demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He
      fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at
      some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree
      branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet
      "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.[2]

      <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
      <p>
        Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their
        mother Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II,
        and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
        long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

        Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and
        uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin.
        Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield,
        and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the quest to reclaim the
        Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who
        bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely
        Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing
        the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He
        fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in
        the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other
        Dwarves of the company of Thorin.

        Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He
        was the younger child of Gróin and younger brother of Óin. In TA 2799,
        Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last
        battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how
        significant his contribution was, being 16 years old. In TA 2879, in the
        Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an
        unknown wife. In March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by
        chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so
        that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits,
        Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would
        never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new
        from the shell".

        Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of
        Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II
        Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain. A Dwarf Lord
        known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of
        Thorin's closest friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to
        him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin. He later went to
        re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was
        overcome once more by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest
        of his companions.

        Quest of Erebor, as well as fighting in and surviving the Battle of Five

        cousin Ori,[1] travelled with Bilbo Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield as a
        member of Thorin's Company on theQuest for Erebor, to reclaim the Lonely
        Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End
        who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the
        forks"; as well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described
        as “decent fellow despite his grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet
        coat while on the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be the
        strongest of the thirteen companions.

        a cousin named Ori,[1] and was a remote kinsman of Thorin Oakenshield.
        He played the flute, and was very fond of regular and plentiful meals
        like his Hobbit friend, Bilbo Baggins.

        Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not
        related to the royal House of Durin. Most of his familial relations are
        unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his
        family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the
        dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior
        worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life at
        his halls in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

        Bofur was a Dwarf who lived in the late Third Age. He is best known as a
        companion of Bilbo Baggins, Thorin Oakenshield, and Gandalf on the quest
        to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, along with his
        brother Bombur and cousin Bifur.

        Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of
        Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line, although he was descended from
        the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown, though it fell
        somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were
        the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin
        was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and
        Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during
        the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue
        Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

        Thorin II Oakenshield and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
        from Smaug, helped form the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One
